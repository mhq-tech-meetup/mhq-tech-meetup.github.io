Interested in helping out with getting this meetup group going, send an email to [mats.lundberg@gmail.com](mailto:mats.lundberg@gmail.com).

Theme with the first series of meetups will be Jenkins and how it's used at different companies. 

First off is [Anders Olsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anderskolsson/), Software Engineer at iZettle and who recently made his way back to the island. He'll offer insight into some of the unique ways iZettle is using Jenkins in their day to day work. Date is not decided yet, but towards the end of November.
